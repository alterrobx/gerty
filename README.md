# GermanQWERTY

Do you have a German/Austrian/Swiss QWERTZ keyboard?<br>
Do you need these special characters (umlaut and sharp s): Ää, Öö, Üü and ẞß?<br>
Are you tired of writing Y instead of Z and vice versa?<br>
Launch GermanQWERTY.exe! No need to install anything!<br>
<br>
The software is based on AutoHotkey.<br>
It simply switches the Y to Z and the Z to Y.<br>
Check the source code.<br>
And do what you want with it! You are a pirate! Arrr!<br>
